### A minimal hand-drawn RubyGems search app

If you're reading this, you're likely evaluating candidates for a front end position at Teachable. Hi! I really hope you like the app.

I worked with React and Styled Components, which I mostly use because they're widely understood. I also really like Vue and Tailwind, and kinda wish I'd taken the opportunity tot try out Svelte or (gasp) plain ol' css/html.

### Running the app

💻 Install a recent version of Node

⏳ Run a quick `npm install`. Grab a coffee.

🆒 This uses Parcel to start up an express server on port 3000 and a React app on 1234

🌍 Open up the app on in your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

###Here's what's cool here:
✅ Works! You can find real gems that are worth installing.

↬ Responsive! It looks fine on modern mobile phones, as well as most modern browsers.

🚫 Untested on ie8!

✍🏼 Hand drawn vibe courtesy of the extremely cool [Wired Elements](https://wiredjs.com/) library, every box in the app renders a little different each time.

💎 Sick favicon

🛀 Pretty clean code!

####(Less cool things):
🧪 I started implementing tests, which took forever to set up because Parcel and Babel and Enzyme and Jest were having weird version incompatibility issues. They're still are there in the git history if you're curious with enzyme and jest with react-axe fo, and then got way behind with my freelance work and nuked them-- because no tests is better than broken tests.

🙁 No pagination, boo.

🔍 Making a resource show in addition to the index view would mean I'd probably never go to rubygems again

ឱ No typing makes us a little more vulnerable to change and makes collaborating a little harder, there is probably a null check or two that Typescript would have asked for that would have perhaps made the code nicer.

### Thanks!
